### Position Forest Transformer For Mathematical Handwriting Expression Recognition

Authors: Srisaran Chandramouli, Sabrina Hirani, Babur Nawyan

## Problem:

## Dataset: 
* CROHME dataset (one combined training test, 3 test sets, single-line mathematical expressions)
* MNE dataset (specifically designed for model performance evaluation, Multi-level Nested Expression, it comprises three subsets categorized based on the nested levels of the expressions: N1, N2, N3)
* HME100K dataset (74,502 training images and 24,607 test images)

## Approach:
We plan to implement a forest position transformer for mathematical handwriting recognition.
