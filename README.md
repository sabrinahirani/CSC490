## Position Forest Transformer For Mathematical Handwriting Expression Recognition

Authors: Srisaran Chandramouli, Sabrina Hirani, Babur Nawyan

### Problem: 
With the increasing advancements in robotics and AI, image recognition and image parsing are fields that are rising in popularity. This project focuses on Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER). Given a 2D image(with one channel) of a handwritten mathematical equation, we aim to recognize the mathematical expression and output its corresponding LATEX code. This idea has a variety of applications ranging from digitization of old articles and journals to test auto-grader.

### Dataset: 
* CROHME dataset (one combined training test, 3 test sets, single-line mathematical expressions)
* MNE dataset (specifically designed for model performance evaluation, Multi-level Nested Expression, it comprises three subsets categorized based on the nested levels of the expressions: N1, N2, N3)
* HME100K dataset (74,502 training images and 24,607 test images)

### Approach:
We plan to implement a forest position transformer for mathematical handwriting expression recognition.
